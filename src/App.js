### Headings

To create a heading, add between 1 and 6 \`#\` in front of the word or phrase. The \`#\` will correspond to the heading level.

# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

###### Heading level 6

### Paragraphs

To create a paragraph, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

### Line Breaks

To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces, and then press return/enter.

This is the first line.  
This is the second line

### Emphasis

To italicize a word or a phrase, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.

*This text will be italic.*

_This text will also be italic._

To bold a word or a phrase, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.

**This text will be bold.**

__This text will also be bold.__

### Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph. If you need to have a blockquote with multiple paragraphs you can add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

If you need to nest blockquotes, add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
>
> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

### Lists

- You can organize items into unordered and ordered lists.

#### Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.

2. Item 2
3. Item 3
  1. Item 3.1
  2. Item 3.2
4. Item 4

### Code Blocks

You can wrap your code with \`\`\` to create a code block, and by adding an optional language your code will get syntax highlighting.  
You can indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

\`\`\`js
console.log("Hello world!");
\`\`\`

    <html>
      <head></head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
